# --- Biological Settings ---
# Options: 'human' or 'mouse' (default is human)
species: "human" 

# --- Algorithm Parameters ---
parameters:
  # How many valid decoys to generate per input sequence
  decoys_per_sequence: 1

  # How strictly the Pgen must match the input sequence.
  # Since we are scrambling, exact matches are rare. 
  # 0.5 means the decoy Pgen is within +/- 0.5 (log10 scale) of the target.
  # Suggested: 0.5 to 1.0 for scrambling.
  pgen_tolerance_log10: 1

  # How different the decoy must be from the input (Levenshtein distance).
  # 2 means at least 2 amino acid changes.
  levenshtein_distance_threshold: 2

  # How many times to try scrambling a sequence before giving up.
  # Scrambling is random, so higher numbers increase success rate but slow down the script.
  max_scramble_iterations: 5000
  anchor_length: 3
